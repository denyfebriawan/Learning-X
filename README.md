  EXPERIENCE
  
  There is so much fun today i can meet all of the LearningX bootcamp participant and using ZEP is a new thing for me.
  
  TEAM PROJECT TOPIC
  
  My team project topic is a warehouse item management that can add some item and you can decrease or increase the item quantity or if the item is no longer on the     warehouse you can delete it
  
  WHAT I HAVE DONE SO FAR
  
  - Brainstorming our team project topic
  - Learn how to create a wireframe through figma

  MY GOAL
  
  My goal at this Bootcamp is to gather all experience and knowledge that i can get from this bootcamp and hopefully i can applied to my future project
